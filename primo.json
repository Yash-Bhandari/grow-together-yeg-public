Property owners will need to get development permits and a suite of upgrades to continue their businesses temporarily — up to seven years for gravel lots and 10 years for paved lots. As of April, the city found only <a href=\"https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/except-for-katz-group-edmonton-says-downtown-surface-parking-lots-have-to-go\">16 of 113 outdoor parking lots</a> in the core were legal.

This only applies to lots that have been operating since Jan. 1 of this year in and around Downtown, Wîhkwêntôwin (formerly Oliver), Chinatown, the Quarters, McCauley, Central McDougall, and Queen Mary Park. No new outdoor parking areas are allowed in the core.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/edmonton-bylaw-illegal-parking-lots-downtown\">Edmonton Journal</a></p>\n<p>While we would like to see more housing built downtown, we also need accountability in our regulatory environment, and speculators generating easy returns from illegal parking lots should be held accountable.

The application was ultimately approved 8-4, with Councillors Cartmell, Hamilton, Paquette and Rice voting against it. \n\n[October 1st public hearing: item 3.12](https://pub-edmonton.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=718d5b89-3ff6-4ed4-bc66-df6bd63153e5&Agenda=PostMinutes&lang=English)\n\n![Site analysis of the proposed site by Situate](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1736902603/jasper-house.png)\n\n![Landscape design intent of the proposed site by Situate](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1736902603/jasper.png)\n\nSituate also brought forward an application in Wîhkwêntôwin to keep Jasper House, a mid-century apartment building located at the confluence of Jasper Avenue, 121 Street and the Victoria Promenade, and to turn its surface parking lot into a new high-rise residential tower with commercial uses in the podium. The community amenity contribution includes 28 three bedroom units in the new building.\n\n## 2. A Low-rise Residential Building on the Corner of 107 Ave and 163 St\n\nA modest four-story on a corner of two major roads, across the street from a car wash and near other low-rise apartments. Approved 9-3, with Councillors Cartmell, Principe, and Rice voting against it.\n\n[December 9th Public Hearing: item 3.3](https://pub-edmonton.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=0b786097-81bf-453a-a38e-bee67789b8c9&Agenda=PostMinutes&lang=English)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1736902603/107-163.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1736902602/youngstown.png )\n\nWe'd like to especially highlight Councillor Cartmell's vote against this application. City staff assessed that this proposal is supported by the District Plans and Policy that Cartmell actually voted in favour of.  But, Cartmell voted no to this concrete proposal that conformed with the same plans and policy he voted for.\n\nWhile electoral posturing this year is tempting, we hope councillors and mayoral candidates will show leadership and still uphold our planning policies when they support more housing, even when it's not convenient.\n\n## Honorable Mention: Bylaw Passage to Crack Down on Unsightly and Illegal Parking Lots\n\nThe bylaw passed 8-2 after Monday’s public hearing, with councillors Jennifer Rice and Tim Cartmell opposed. The mayor and councillors Karen Principe and Aaron Paquette were absent for the vote.\n\nWe are glad to see that the City Council are cracking down on illegal parking lots, and while we would like to see these sites developed into housing, the compromise proposed would help beautify and improve the streetscape of downtown in the interim until such future development occurs. Advocates from the community as well as lobbyists from the Downtown Business Association and even some competing developers spoke in support of the bylaw compromise.\n\n> City council on Monday passed a bylaw meant to make around 120 parking lots in central neighbourhoods safer and better-looking by the end of June 2026, or face enforcement action. Property owners will need to get development permits and a suite of upgrades to continue their businesses temporarily — up to seven years for gravel lots and 10 years for paved lots. As of April, the city found only [16 of 113 outdoor parking lots](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/except-for-katz-group-edmonton-says-downtown-surface-parking-lots-have-to-go) in the core were legal. Many have been operating illegally for [more than a decade](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/crackdown-on-illegal-parking-lots-puts-cheap-spaces-in-peril-east-of-downtown) without consequences.\n\n> Under the new rules, property owners have 18 months to get their permits and install trees and shrubs around the outside of lots, set up lighting, proper drainage, accessible stalls, and walkways through larger properties, with at least two metres of space required between roads and parking stalls. This only applies to lots that have been operating since Jan. 1 of this year in and around Downtown, Wîhkwêntôwin (formerly Oliver), Chinatown, the Quarters, McCauley, Central McDougall, and Queen Mary Park. No new outdoor parking areas are allowed in the core.\n\nSource: [Edmonton Journal](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/edmonton-bylaw-illegal-parking-lots-downtown)\n\nWhile we would like to see more housing built downtown, we also need accountability in our regulatory environment, and speculators generating easy returns from illegal parking lots should be held accountable. We hope the increased standards improve downtown in the meantime. This modest compromise should have passed unanimously.\n\n\n"}}},"page":"bfa1e486-e754-4950-a629-4a29a70367d3","symbol":"e96f0ae0-c473-4056-a2de-00b445dafd34","index":2},{"id":"b9f6bd09-7a32-45d1-84c1-66d989bbbf9b","content":{"en":{"logo":{"image":{"alt":"","src":"\thttps://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1692598023/gtyeg_logo_no_text_darker_kfvwjs.svg","url":"\thttps://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1692598023/gtyeg_logo_no_text_darker_kfvwjs.svg","size":null},"title":"Grow Together Edmonton"},"site_nav":[{"link":{"url":"/","label":"Home","active":false}},{"link":{"url":"/about","label":"About Us"}},{"link":{"url":"/blog","label":"News"}},{"link":{"url":"/#take-action","label":"Get Involved"}}],"logo_width":"100"}},"page":"08d2500a-8391-407a-967f-b18945d67f52","symbol":"cf04b40d-6c25-4f29-81f8-5a641d5c084f","index":0},{"id":"57f5e858-3f93-4a68-803c-cc160b5b1af9","content":{"en":{"teasers":[{"link":{"url":"/blog/blatchford-not-enough","label":"Blatchford","active":false},"image":{"alt":"Blatchford infographic","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1751842750/blatchford_drhmha.png"},"title":"The Blatchford Myth: Why One or Two Dense Developments Won't Solve Edmonton's Housing Crisis","description":{"html":"<p>Even if we built ten more Blatchfords, we'd still fall short of Edmonton's housing needs.

In Calgary, the average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment is now up to $1718/month—that's about 3 weeks of pre-tax earnings for a full time minimum wage worker. And in just the past year, **rents in Edmonton have risen 18%** while [our vacancy rate dropped from 7% to 4%, reaching a 10-year low](<https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/rents-may-rise-in-edmonton-as-vacancy-rate-hits-10-year-low-affordability-crunched>).\n\nThe crux of the issue is that we don't have enough homes. In Canada, [we build fewer houses today than we did back in 1976](<https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3410012601>) even though [population growth has more than tripled](<https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/population_and_demography/40-million>). We have the fewest houses per person [out of all G7 countries](<https://businesscouncilab.com/insights-category/economic-insights/weekly-econ-minute-canada-housing-shortage/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20Canada%20has%20the,480%20dwellings%20per%201%2C000%20residents.>). [There isn't some massive secret supply of vacant homes](<https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2019/08/19/running-on-empties/>). Canada just doesn't have enough homes.\n\n### Relaxing zoning rules boosts the supply of housing, slowing down rent increases\n\nFor decades, zoning bylaws in Canadian cities have outlawed medium density housing by default on the vast majority of residential land. In Edmonton, there are entire neighborhoods where the only infill housing that can feasibly be built [under our current rules](<https://www.datalabto.ca/a-visual-guide-to-detached-houses-in-5-canadian-cities/>) are $600k+ detached/semi-detached houses. To build anything denser would require a long, risky and expensive rezoning process. And even in areas where row houses, multiplexes and small apartments are allowed, they face many onerous restrictions that make them significantly more expensive to build.\n\nIf Edmonton is to remain affordable, then we need to remove barriers to building new homes in existing neighbourhoods. Here's how this reduces housing costs:\n\n1. Land for medium density housing will become much less scarce, and therefore cheaper. Combined with a shorter and less risky approval process, many new housing projects will make financial sense to build. This will boost our housing stock, helping to keep rents in check.\n\n2. It will enable more affordable housing options. Not everyone wants or can afford a large detached house, but in many neighborhoods there are few alternatives. The new zoning bylaw will allow rowhouses, multiplexes and small apartments (3 storeys or less) in every neighbourhood.\n\n3. A major contributor to the high price of infill housing is the cost of purchasing land and demolishing existing structures. Our new zoning rules would permit higher density housing, allowing builders to spread those fixed costs over more units with a larger total living space.\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n### Case Study: Auckland, NZ\n\nAuckland, New Zealand is a rare example of a city that undertook zoning reform as comprehensive as ours.

These concerns are understandable, but they're based on outdated assumptions about how our neighbourhoods have changed and how modern homes actually work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thepopulationrealitywererepopulatingnotovercrowding\">The Population Reality: We're Repopulating, Not Overcrowding</h2>\n<p>Here's a fact that might surprise you: Edmonton's mature neighbourhoods are actually <em>less</em> populated today than they were 50 years ago. According to <ins><a href=\"https://www.jacobdawang.com/blog/2025/population-growth-rowhouses/\">analysis of census data</a></ins>, most of our inner-city areas have seen significant population decline since 1971.</p>\n<p>Take Crestwood, for example. This established neighbourhood had 3,445 residents in 1971 but only 2,415 in 2021: a 30% decrease in population over 50 years. The same pattern holds across mature neighbourhoods throughout the city. Large family homes that once housed six or eight people now house just two or three.</p>\n<p>This means the infrastructure in these neighbourhoods was originally designed and built to serve many more people than currently live there. When we build a duplex or a small apartment building in these areas, we're not pushing infrastructure beyond its limits: we're simply making better use of systems that are already in place and underutilized.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1751641449/pop_change_table_rpwste.png\" alt=\"Selected neighbourhood 7-8plex development profiles\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"modernhomesusewaylesswater\">Modern Homes Use Way Less Water</h2>\n<p>Even if we were adding the same number of people to these neighbourhoods, today's homes are dramatically more efficient than those built decades ago. The numbers are striking:</p>\n<p><strong>Toilets</strong>: Older toilets from before 1982 use <ins><a href=\"https://www.savingwater.org/indoors/toilets/how-much-water-does-your-toilet-use/\">19-26 litres per flush</a></ins>, while modern efficient toilets use just 4.8 litres per flush. That's an 80% reduction in water usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Showers</strong>: Old-style showerheads can use up to 20 litres per minute, while modern efficient models use <ins><a href=\"https://www.crd.ca/environment/water-conservation/conserving-water-home/indoor-water-use#high-efficiency-fixtures-and-appliances\">9 litres per minute or less</a></ins>, cutting water usage by more than half⁴.</p>\n<p><strong>Dishwashers and washing machines</strong>: These appliances have seen similar efficiency improvements, using a fraction of the water their predecessors required.</p>\n<p>When you add up all these improvements, a new home today uses significantly less water than an equivalent home from the 1970s or 1980s.

These concerns are understandable, but they're based on outdated assumptions about how our neighbourhoods have changed and how modern homes actually work.\n\n## The Population Reality: We're Repopulating, Not Overcrowding\n\nHere's a fact that might surprise you: Edmonton's mature neighbourhoods are actually *less* populated today than they were 50 years ago. According to <ins>[analysis of census data](https://www.jacobdawang.com/blog/2025/population-growth-rowhouses/)</ins>, most of our inner-city areas have seen significant population decline since 1971.\n\nTake Crestwood, for example. This established neighbourhood had 3,445 residents in 1971 but only 2,415 in 2021: a 30% decrease in population over 50 years. The same pattern holds across mature neighbourhoods throughout the city. Large family homes that once housed six or eight people now house just two or three.\n\nThis means the infrastructure in these neighbourhoods was originally designed and built to serve many more people than currently live there. When we build a duplex or a small apartment building in these areas, we're not pushing infrastructure beyond its limits: we're simply making better use of systems that are already in place and underutilized.\n\n![Selected neighbourhood 7-8plex development profiles](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1751641449/pop_change_table_rpwste.png)\n\n## Modern Homes Use Way Less Water\n\nEven if we were adding the same number of people to these neighbourhoods, today's homes are dramatically more efficient than those built decades ago. The numbers are striking:\n\n**Toilets**: Older toilets from before 1982 use <ins>[19-26 litres per flush](https://www.savingwater.org/indoors/toilets/how-much-water-does-your-toilet-use/)</ins>, while modern efficient toilets use just 4.8 litres per flush. That's an 80% reduction in water usage.\n\n**Showers**: Old-style showerheads can use up to 20 litres per minute, while modern efficient models use <ins>[9 litres per minute or less](https://www.crd.ca/environment/water-conservation/conserving-water-home/indoor-water-use#high-efficiency-fixtures-and-appliances)</ins>, cutting water usage by more than half⁴.\n\n**Dishwashers and washing machines**: These appliances have seen similar efficiency improvements, using a fraction of the water their predecessors required.\n\nWhen you add up all these improvements, a new home today uses significantly less water than an equivalent home from the 1970s or 1980s. This means even with more housing units, the total demand on water and sewer systems may actually be lower than in previous decades.\n\n## EPCOR Ensures Infrastructure Can Handle Development\n\nThere's a built-in safeguard that many people don't know about: Edmonton's utility provider, EPCOR, doesn't allow any development to proceed unless existing infrastructure can accommodate it.\n\nBefore any new housing can be built, developers must demonstrate that there's adequate water and sewer capacity. If the existing infrastructure can't handle the additional demand, it must be upgraded at the developer's expense before construction can begin.\n\nThis is exactly why the City of Edmonton created the <ins>[Infill Infrastructure Fund](https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/infill-infrastructure-fund)</ins> to help cover these upgrade costs when they're needed. The fund ensures that necessary infrastructure improvements, if required, aren't a barrier to getting more homes built.\n\n## The Efficiency Bonus: How Infill Actually Improves Infrastructure\n\nBeyond simply not overloading existing systems, infill development actually makes our infrastructure work *better*. When more people live in mature neighbourhoods, the fixed costs of maintaining water mains, sewer lines, and roads get spread across more households. This is far more efficient than building entirely new infrastructure to serve sprawling developments on the city's edges.\n\nDense, walkable neighbourhoods also reduce strain on our transportation infrastructure. When people can walk to the corner store instead of driving across town, it means less wear on roads and less demand for new road construction. Every sixplex or eightplex built in a mature neighbourhood represents several car trips that don't need to happen.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe infrastructure argument against infill development doesn't hold up to scrutiny.

Policy 2.5.2.6 says the City will only consider additional height in locations outside nodes and corridors if they are within 400m of a mass transit station and meet another criterion. Given many LRT station areas in high-demand areas are not covered in large part by nodes and corridors, revising these policies to provide outright support for higher density housing near LRT is crucial.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1716614934/low-rise-policy_r3pczr.png\" alt=\"Policy 2.5.2.5 from District Policy\" />\n<em>Policy 2.5.2.5 from District Policy</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnijop5c/image/upload/v1716614934/consider-policy_nuqpur.png\" alt=\"Policy 2.5.2.6 from District Policy\" />\n<em>Policy 2.5.2.6 from District Policy</em></p>\n<p>We recommend that City Council revise these policies to provide <strong>outright support for mid-rise density or higher within an 800m radius from transit stations,</strong> approximately a 15 minute walk.
